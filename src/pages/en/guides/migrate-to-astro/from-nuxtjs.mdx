[NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org) is a framework for building web applications on top of Vue.

After following the guidance on this page, you probably won't have your new Astro site exactly the way you want it yet.

But, this guide gives you some key concepts and migration strategies to help you get started. Use the rest of our docs and our [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) to keep going!

## Key Similarities between Nuxt and Astro

Nuxt and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both Nuxt and Astro are modern Javascript static-site generators with similar project file structures. Both use a `src/` folder for your project files and a special `src/pages/` folder for file-based routing. Creating and managing pages for your site should feel familiar.

- Astro has [an official integration for using Vue components](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/) and support for NPM packages and community integrations, including several for Vue. You will be able to write Vue UI components for interactivity, and may be able to keep some or all of your existing Nuxt Vue components and dependencies.

- Astro and Nuxt both allow you to use Headless CMSs, APIs or Markdown files for data. You can continue to use your preferred authoring system, and will be able to keep your existing content.

## Key Differences between Nuxt and Astro

When you rebuild your Nuxt site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- [MPA vs SPA](/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/): Nuxt is a Vue-based SPA (single-page application). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using `.astro` components, but can also support React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, Lit and raw HTML templating.

- [Page Routing](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/#file-based-routing): Nuxt uses `vue-router` for SPA routing, and `vue-meta` for managing `<head>`. In Astro, you will create separate HTML page routes and control your page `<head>` directly, or in a layout component.

- [Content-focus](/en/concepts/why-astro/): Astro was designed primarily for content-focused sites. While Nuxt has the capability to do content-focused sites through `@nuxt/content`, it's primarily geared towards interactive websites. This differs from Astro, which has built-in capabilities for content page generation, but may be difficult to replicate interactive components such as dashboards within.

## Convert your Project

### Create a new Astro project

Use `npm create astro@latest` to launch Astro's CLI wizard or choose a community theme from the [Astro Theme Showcase](https://astro.build/themes). 


You can also pass a `--template` argument to the `create-astro` command to start from an existing Astro repository on GitHub:

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    npm create astro -- --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm create astro --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn create astro --template <github-username>/<github-repo>
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Then, copy your existing Gatsby project files over to your new Astro project into a separate folder outside of `src`.

### Install integrations (optional)

You may find it useful to install some of [Astro's optional integrations](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to use while converting your Nuxt project to Astro:

- **@astrojs/vue**: to reuse some existing Vue UI components in your new Astro site, or keep writing with Vue components.

- **@astrojs/image**: to replace Nuxt's Image plugin with Astro's own image-optimizing components.

- **@astrojs/mdx**: to bring existing MDX files from your Nuxt project, or to use MDX in your new Astro site.

### Put your source code in `src`

1. **Move** Nuxt's `static/` folder to `public/`. 
   
    Astro uses the `public/` directory for static assets, similar to Nuxt's `static/` folder.

2. **Copy or Move** Nuxt's other files and folders (e.g. `pages`, `layouts` etc.) into Astro's `src/` folder.

    Like Nuxt, Astro's `src/pages/` folder is a special folder used for file-based routing. All other folders are optional, and you can organize the contents of your `src/` folder any way you like. Other common folders in Astro projects include `src/layouts/`, `src/components`, `src/styles`, `src/scripts`.


### Repurpose config file

Astro has a configuration file at the root of your project called [`astro.config.mjs`](/en/guides/configuring-astro/). This is used only for configuring your Astro project and any installed integrations, including [SSR adapters](/en/guides/deploy/).

### Convert Vue SFC files to `.astro` files

Here are some tips for converting a Nuxt `.vue` component into a `.astro` component:

1. Use the `<template>` of the existing NuxtJS component function as the basis for your HTML template.

2. Change any [Nuxt or Vue syntax to Astro](#convert-nuxtjs-syntax-to-astro) (e.g. `<NextLink>`, `:class`, `{{variable}}`, `v-if`) or to HTML web standards.

1. Move `<script>` JavaScript, into a "code fence" (`---`).

4. Write an `Astro.props` statement to access any additional props that were previously passed to your Vue component.

4. Decide whether any imported components also need to be converted to Astro. With the official integration installed, you can [use existing Vue components in your Astro file](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/). But, you may want to convert them to Astro, especially if they do not need to be interactive!

See [an example from a Nuxt app converted step-by-step](#examples-from-nuxtjs).

#### Compare: Vue vs Astro

Compare the following Nuxt component and a corresponding Astro component:

<AstroVueTabs>
  <Fragment slot="vue">
    ```vue title="Page.vue"
    <template>
      <div>
        <p v-if="message === 'Not found'">
          The repository you're looking up doesn't exist
        </p>
        <div v-else>
          <Header/>
          <p class="banner">Astro has {{stars}} üßë‚ÄçüöÄ</p>
          <Footer />
        </div>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script>
    import Vue from 'vue'
    
    export default Vue.extend({
      name: 'IndexPage',
      async asyncData() {
        const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/withastro/astro')
        const json = await res.json();
        return {
          message: json.message,
          stars: json.stargazers_count || 0,
        };
      }
    });
    </script>
    
    <style scoped>
    .banner {
      background-color: #f4f4f4;
      padding: 1em 1.5em;
      text-align: center;
      margin-bottom: 1em;
    }
    <style>
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="astro">
    ```astro title="Page.astro"
    ---
    import Header from "./header";
    import Footer from './footer';
    import "./layout.css";

    const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/withastro/astro')
    const json = await res.json()
    const message = json.message;
    const stars = json.stargazers_count || 0;
    ---
    
    {message === "Not Found" ? 
          <p>The repository you're looking up doesn't exist</p> :
          <>
                <Header />
                <p class="banner">Astro has {stars} üßë‚ÄçüöÄ</p>
                <Footer />
            </> 
    }
    
    <style>
      .banner {
        background-color: #f4f4f4; 
        padding: 1em 1.5em;
        text-align: center;
        margin-bottom: 1em;
      }
    <style>
    ```
  </Fragment>
</AstroVueTabs>

### Migrating Layout Files

In Astro, your layout must include a full page shell (`<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags). Your Nuxt `layout.vue` and templates will not include these. 

You can use the following code to provide these extra elements around an existing Nuxt layout file, or write your own:

```astro title="src/layouts/Layout.astro"
---
---
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Astro</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<slot />
	</body>
</html>
```

You may also wish to reuse code from [your Nuxt's page's `head` property](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-head/#the-head-property) to include additional site meta data. Notice that Astro uses neither `vue-meta` nor a component's `head` property but instead accesses `<head>` directly. You may create and import components, even within `<head>`, to separate and organize your page content.

### Migrating Pages and Posts

In Next.js, your posts either live in `/pages` or `/app/routeName/page.jsx`.

In Astro, **your pages must live within `src/pages/`**. You will not have to configure any routing behavior for your Astro, Markdown and MDX files.

#### Vue pages

Your existing Nuxt JSX (`.vue`) pages will need to be [converted from JSX files to `.astro` pages](#convert-jsx-files-to-astro-files).

#### Markdown and MDX pages

Next.js has no built-in support for Markdown and an optional integration for MDX files. If your existing project contains Markdown or MDX files, you no longer need to manually create pages for each Markdown-generated route. However, your existing Markdown and MDX pages may require some adjustments to their frontmatter, such as adding [Astro's special `layout` frontmatter property](/en/core-concepts/layouts/#markdownmdx-layouts).

With dynamic routing, your Markdown posts may exist outside of `src/pages/` but they should still be kept within your project source folder (e.g. `src/posts/`) so that the dynamic page file (e.g. `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` can import their data.)

### Migrating Tests

As Astro outputs raw HTML, it is possible to write end-to-end tests using the output of the build step. Any end-to-end tests written previously might work out-of-the-box, if you have been able to match the markup of your Next site. Testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library can be imported and used in Astro to test your React components.

See Astro's [testing guide](/en/guides/testing/) for more.

## Reference: Convert NuxtJS Syntax to Astro

### Nuxt Variable Interpolation to Astro

{/* TODO: Update this */}

Don't use `{{}}`. Instead just use `{}` for expressions

### Nuxt Property Passing to Astro

Instead of `v-bind:attr="jsVar"` or `:attr="jsVar"`, use `attr={jsVar}` 

### Nuxt Links to Astro

Convert any Nuxt `<NuxtLink to="">`components to HTML `<a href="">` tags. 

Astro does not use any special component for links, although you are welcome to build custom link components. You can then import and use this `<Link>` just as you would any other component.

```astro title="src/components/Link.astro"
---
const { to } = Astro.props
---
<a href={to}><slot /></a>
```

### Nuxt Imports to Astro

If necesssary, update any file imports to reference relative file paths exactly. This can be done using [import aliases](/en/guides/typescript/#import-aliases), or by writing out a relative path in full (e.g. `../../layouts/Layout.astro`). 

Note that `.astro` and several other file types must be imported with their full file extension.

### Nuxt Slots to Astro

Just like Vue has slots to pass children to a component, Astro components do as well. Astro even supports using [named slots](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#named-slots):

```astro title="src/components/PageHeader.astro"
<header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <slot name="navItems"/>
        </ul>
    </nav>
	<slot/>
</header>
```

See more about [specific `<slot />` usage in Astro](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#slots).

### Nuxt Dynamic Page Generation to Astro

{/* TODO: Update this */}

`getStaticPaths` is `generate`, does not live alongside `pages` component, but rather the `config` file:

- https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate/

### Nuxt Data Fetching to Astro

{/* TODO: Update this */}

Nuxt has two methods of generating data:

- [`asyncData` options API](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching/#async-data) akin to `getStaticProps`
- [`fetch` hook](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching/#the-fetch-hook) which loads data either on client or server (no 1:1 match)

See more about [local files imports with `Astro.glob()`](/en/guides/imports/#astroglob).

### Nuxt Styling to Astro

{/* TODO: Update this */}

`<style>` is default `scoped` in Astro

Nuxt2 has SASS support:

- https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-css/
- Seems like others supported via Webpack

See more about [Styling in Astro](/en/guides/styling/).

### Nuxt Image Plugin to Astro

Convert any [Nuxt `<nuxt-img/>` or `<nuxt-picture/>` components](https://image.nuxtjs.org/components/nuxt-img) with [Astro's own image integration components](/en/guides/images/#astros-image-integration), or with a standard HTML `<img>` tag.

You can learn more about [using images in Astro](/en/guides/images/) in the Images Guide.

## Guided examples: See the steps!

Here is an example of small NuxtJS Pok√©dex application converted to Astro.

This walks through converting three individual files to `.astro` files:

- `layouts/default.vue` for providing a layout becomes `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- `pages/index.vue` Pokemon list page becomes `src/pages/index.astro`
- `pages/pokemon/_name.js` for dynamic routing becomes `src/pages/[name].astro`
